# Feedback System Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented to ensure that only genuine clients who have completed their massage sessions can submit feedback, and only once per session.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Multi-Layer Authentication System

#### Booking Verification
- **Required Credentials**: Booking ID, Email, and Phone Number
- **Database Validation**: All three credentials must match exactly with the booking record
- **Session Status Check**: Only completed sessions are eligible for feedback
- **Time-based Restrictions**: 
  - Sessions must be completed within the last 30 days
  - Bookings must be at least 1 day old (prevents fake bookings)
  - Future sessions are rejected

#### Session Token System
- **Cryptographic Token**: SHA-256 hash generated from booking details + secret
- **One-time Use**: Token is generated during verification and required for feedback submission
- **Server-side Validation**: Token is validated on the server to prevent tampering

### 2. Rate Limiting & Anti-Spam Protection

#### IP-based Rate Limiting
- **Attempt Limits**: 3 attempts per 5 minutes per IP address
- **Email-based Limits**: 2 attempts per 10 minutes per email address
- **Automatic Blocking**: Excessive attempts result in temporary blocks

#### Fraud Detection
- **Suspicious Pattern Detection**: Maximum 3 feedback submissions per email per 24 hours
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Database constraint ensures one feedback per booking
- **Real-time Monitoring**: All attempts are logged for security analysis

### 3. Data Validation & Sanitization

#### Input Validation
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas validate all input data
- **Type Checking**: Strict type validation for all fields
- **Format Validation**: Email format, phone number format, and content length checks

#### SQL Injection Prevention
- **Parameterized Queries**: All database queries use parameterized statements
- **Input Sanitization**: Dangerous SQL patterns are filtered out
- **Database Constraints**: Foreign key constraints and unique constraints

### 4. Security Audit & Monitoring

#### Comprehensive Logging
- **Security Audit Table**: All verification and feedback attempts are logged
- **Client Information**: IP address, user agent, and timestamp are recorded
- **Action Tracking**: Success/failure status and reasons are documented

#### Real-time Monitoring
- **Console Logging**: Security events are logged to console for monitoring
- **Database Tracking**: All security events stored in `feedback_security_audit` table
- **Pattern Analysis**: Suspicious patterns are automatically detected

## Database Schema Security

### Feedback Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE feedback (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
  comment TEXT NOT NULL,
  booking_id INTEGER REFERENCES bookings(id) NOT NULL,
  client_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  client_phone VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
  ip_address VARCHAR(45),
  user_agent TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(booking_id)  -- Ensures one feedback per booking
);
```

### Security Audit Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE feedback_security_audit (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  booking_id INTEGER REFERENCES bookings(id),
  client_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  client_phone VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
  ip_address VARCHAR(45),
  user_agent TEXT,
  action_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  reason TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## API Security Endpoints

### 1. Verification Endpoint (`/api/feedback/verify`)
**Purpose**: Verify booking eligibility before allowing feedback submission

**Security Measures**:
- Validates booking ID, email, and phone combination
- Checks session completion status
- Enforces time-based restrictions
- Generates secure session token
- Logs all verification attempts

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "canSubmit": true,
  "sessionToken": "hash-generated-token",
  "booking": {
    "id": "booking-id",
    "name": "client-name",
    "serviceDate": "session-date"
  }
}
```

### 2. Feedback Submission Endpoint (`/api/feedback`)
**Purpose**: Submit feedback with enhanced security validation

**Security Measures**:
- Validates session token
- Enforces rate limiting
- Checks for duplicate submissions
- Validates all input data
- Logs security events
- Prevents future session feedback

## Frontend Security

### Two-Step Verification Process
1. **Booking Verification**: Client must verify booking details first
2. **Feedback Submission**: Only after successful verification

### Form Security
- **Hidden Fields**: Sensitive data (session token) stored in hidden fields
- **Client-side Validation**: Immediate feedback on input errors
- **Server-side Validation**: All data validated again on server

### User Experience Security
- **Clear Messaging**: Users understand security requirements
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Only show feedback form after verification
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages without exposing system details

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security validation
- Redundant checks at different levels
- Fail-safe mechanisms

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- Only verified clients can submit feedback
- Minimal data exposure in responses
- Restricted access to sensitive operations

### 3. Secure by Default
- All security measures enabled by default
- No bypass mechanisms for convenience
- Strict validation rules

### 4. Continuous Monitoring
- Real-time security event logging
- Pattern detection for suspicious activity
- Audit trail for all operations

## Threat Mitigation

### 1. Fake Feedback Prevention
- **Booking Verification**: Must have valid completed booking
- **Time Restrictions**: Prevents feedback for non-existent sessions
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Database constraints prevent multiple submissions

### 2. Spam & Abuse Prevention
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents rapid-fire submissions
- **IP Tracking**: Monitors for suspicious IP patterns
- **Email Validation**: Ensures legitimate email addresses

### 3. Data Integrity Protection
- **Input Validation**: Prevents malicious data injection
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and validation

### 4. Session Hijacking Prevention
- **Cryptographic Tokens**: Secure session token generation
- **Server-side Validation**: All tokens validated on server
- **Time-limited Tokens**: Tokens tied to specific verification session

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Security Metrics to Monitor
1. **Failed Verification Attempts**: High failure rates may indicate attacks
2. **Rate Limit Violations**: Excessive attempts from same source
3. **Suspicious Patterns**: Multiple submissions from same email/IP
4. **Token Validation Failures**: Invalid session tokens

### Recommended Alerts
- Multiple failed verification attempts from same IP
- High rate of feedback submissions from same email
- Unusual patterns in user agent strings
- Geographic anomalies in IP addresses

## Compliance & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only necessary data is collected
- **Secure Storage**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging for compliance requirements

### Privacy Considerations
- **IP Address Logging**: Used only for security purposes
- **User Agent Logging**: Helps detect automated attacks
- **Data Retention**: Audit logs retained for security analysis

## Future Security Enhancements

### Recommended Improvements
1. **CAPTCHA Integration**: For high-risk scenarios
2. **Email Verification**: Send verification codes to booking email
3. **SMS Verification**: Two-factor authentication via SMS
4. **Geographic Restrictions**: Limit feedback to service area
5. **Machine Learning**: AI-powered fraud detection

### Advanced Security Features
1. **Behavioral Analysis**: Track user interaction patterns
2. **Device Fingerprinting**: Identify suspicious devices
3. **Real-time Threat Intelligence**: Integrate with security feeds
4. **Automated Response**: Automatic blocking of suspicious activity

## Conclusion

The feedback system implements comprehensive security measures to ensure that only genuine clients who have completed their massage sessions can submit feedback, and only once per session. The multi-layered approach provides robust protection against various attack vectors while maintaining a good user experience for legitimate clients.

The system is designed to be secure by default, continuously monitored, and easily extensible for future security enhancements.
