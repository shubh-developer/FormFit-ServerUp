# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the FormaFit service application.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Enhanced Zod Schemas**: All input validation uses enhanced Zod schemas with security patterns
- **XSS Prevention**: Comprehensive sanitization using DOMPurify and custom patterns
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries with additional sanitization
- **Pattern Matching**: Blocks common attack patterns in input fields

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure JWT implementation with proper expiration and validation
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds for secure password storage
- **Admin Authentication**: Role-based access control for admin functions
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with HTTP-only cookies

### 3. Rate Limiting
- **Request Limiting**: 100 requests per 15-minute window per IP
- **User Agent Tracking**: Additional tracking using user agent strings
- **Configurable Limits**: Environment-based rate limiting configuration

### 4. CORS Protection
- **Origin Validation**: Strict CORS policy with allowed origins
- **Method Restrictions**: Limited HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- **Header Validation**: Restricted allowed headers

### 5. Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy**: Comprehensive CSP to prevent XSS
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS in production
- **Referrer Policy**: Controls referrer information

### 6. Database Security
- **Connection Pooling**: Secure connection management
- **Parameterized Queries**: Prevents SQL injection
- **Query Logging**: Security event logging for database operations
- **SSL Support**: Encrypted connections in production

### 7. API Security
- **Input Sanitization**: All API inputs are sanitized
- **Validation Middleware**: Comprehensive validation for all endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information leakage
- **Request Logging**: Security event logging for all API requests

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Password Security
- Minimum 8 characters
- Require uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- bcrypt hashing with 12 salt rounds
- Regular password rotation

### 2. Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Pattern matching for common attack vectors
- Length restrictions on all fields
- Type checking and conversion

### 3. Error Handling
- No sensitive information in error messages
- Secure logging of security events
- Graceful error handling without information leakage

### 4. Session Management
- Secure session cookies
- Session timeout after 24 hours
- HTTP-only and secure flags in production
- SameSite strict policy

## Security Monitoring

### 1. Logging
- All security events are logged
- Request/response logging for API endpoints
- Database query logging
- Error logging with context

### 2. Rate Limiting Monitoring
- Track rate limit violations
- Monitor for potential DDoS attacks
- Alert on unusual traffic patterns

### 3. Input Validation Monitoring
- Track validation failures
- Monitor for potential attack patterns
- Alert on suspicious input attempts

## Production Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Update JWT and session secrets
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Set up security monitoring
- [ ] Configure proper logging
- [ ] Test all security features
- [ ] Review and update dependencies

### Ongoing Security
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Security log monitoring
- [ ] Regular backup testing
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Security training for team

## Security Incident Response

### 1. Detection
- Monitor security logs
- Set up alerts for suspicious activity
- Regular security assessments

### 2. Response
- Immediate isolation of affected systems
- Investigation and root cause analysis
- Communication with stakeholders
- Implementation of fixes

### 3. Recovery
- System restoration from backups
- Security patch implementation
- Post-incident review
- Process improvement
